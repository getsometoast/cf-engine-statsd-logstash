Watching cf-engine Converge
=========================

A logstash config I put together to pump the percentage of promises kept, repaired and not repaired into statsd to allow us to view cf-engine converging in graphite.  You don't need a logging platform to use this.  You could also achieve the same thing with logster by the boffins from etsy.
