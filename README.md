Watching cf-engine Converge
=========================

A logstash config I put together to pump the percentage of promises kept, repaired and not repaired into statsd to allow us to view cf-engine converging in graphite.  In order to use this you will need java and the logstash agent installed on your server.  If you don't want to install those things, you could also achieve the same results with logster by the boffins from etsy.
